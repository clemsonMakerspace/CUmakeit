The green is our scope for the semester,
The yellow is unlikely features,
The red is infeasable features.

This is to allow our team to focus on the most valuable sections of the DB,
giving us time to implement it well and provide time for testing the implementation.

NOTE: the rest of the DB (yellow/red) is still created but empty,and is meant for future
teams / programmers to focus on continued improvement.
