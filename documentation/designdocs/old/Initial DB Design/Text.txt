The purpose for our DB design was initially:
    1. Security built into the DB via relation between certified users 
       and tasks. If someone would make a task that they are not certified
       for, then it wouldnt allow the task to enter the DB. This is not only
       good design, but prevents security errors should a future team change
       the web / app layer. 
         
    2. A table tracking machines and a table tracking locations, allowing the
       makerspace to expand by simply adding a entry
       
    3. A table tracking CUStudent info and login history, to provide easy access
       to credentials as well as foregin keys to allow for easy querries (IE
       statements we would write to produce valuable user info).
    3B.The makerspace user is seperate from CUStudent since during events, a
       guest may not nesseserily be a student.
